Code for the experiments from our workshop paper "A Comparison of Unsupervised Methods for Ad-hoc Cross-Lingual Document Retrieval"

```
mltm.py 
```
This is an implementation of the Polylingual Topic Model (Mimno et al., 2009)

This contains the two embedding-based method for cross-lingual document retrieval: Wasserstein distance (Balikas et al., 2018) and Cr5 (Josifoski et al., 2019)
